## Setup:

1. (For project isolation) create & activate a virtual environment (dependencies are installed within the virtual environment other than system-wide & all subsequent steps will be performed within the virtual environment):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Upgrade the pip package manager to the latest version within the current Python environment: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
3. Install Python dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` file: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Install the openpyxl package for working with Excel files: `pip install openpyxl`
5. Update the `requirements.txt` file: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`, so others can install all the packages and their respective versions specified in the requirements.txt file.
